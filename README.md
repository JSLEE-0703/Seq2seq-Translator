## Conclusion
This project already has a quite complete framework. Currently, due to the simplicity of the data set, there are problems with the translation of long and complex sentences as well as some unfamiliar word combinations. If you want to further improve the translation effect, please use a higher-quality data set. If you have any suggestions for improvement, please contact me.
